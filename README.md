Rock-Scissors-Paper is a simple two-player game where players make gestures with their hands, representing a rock, scissors or paper. This is a python implementation of the game.

This implementation involves a user playing against a computer.

The game rules are as follows:
  
If both players select the same gestures(rock, scissors or paper), it is a tie. 
If a player selects a rock and the other selects a pair of scissors, then the first player wins. 
If a player selects a paper and the other, a rock, then the first player wins.
If a player selects a pair of scissors and the other, a paper, then the first player wins.
